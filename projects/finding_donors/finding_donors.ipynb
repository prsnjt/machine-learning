    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Application: As introduced in this course, Naive Bayes can be used for email spam filtering. Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the presence of the words in the email, with spam and non-spam e-mails. Then Bayes' theorem is used to calculate a probability that given these words are present, an email is or is not spam.\n",
    "- Model Strengths: It is relatively easy to implement, handles large feature sets well and runs relatively efficiently making is easy to train. \n",
    "- Model Weaknesses: The weakness comes from the \"naive\" part of name. This model does not work well when there are special relationships between the words/features such as the sequence in which they appear. \n",
    "- Relevance: This is a good candidate model because we have a lot of features to consider and we are only trying to make a classification, not predict a continuous value of income. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- Application: SVMs are used in image processing problems. One example is face(or any feature) detection, where the model classifies the pixels as -1 (non-face) and +1(face), creating a boundary around the face within a image. Another application is image classification where a SVM model can predict whether the image is of something that it has been trained on. \n",
    "- Model Strengths: SVM can work well even in a complicated domain (high dimensionality/lots of features), as long as there is a clear margin of seperation/boundary. \n",
    "- Model Weaknesses: The model is computationally intensive so large datasets will take to compute/train. Also, if the decision boundaries are quite fuzzy due to the presence of noise in the data, this can also make the model preform badly.\n",
    "- Relevance: This is a good candidate model because it is able to deal with high dimensionality. We have a lot of features to consider after having applied the feature encoding. Hopefully the dataset is not too large...\n",

    "- Model Strengths: Reduced chance of over fitting as we are averaging out several decision trees(which are prone to overfitting).\n",
    "- Model Weaknesses: The model is more complex which means it's more compuattionally intensive to train and understand how exactly the model is making the prediction. \n",

The accuracy score means both models predicted about 80% of the individuals income bracket correctly. The F-score of 70%, which is more of a weighted score of correctly predicted to falsely predicted probably gives a better indication of the performance. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model significantly underperformed compared to the others and is not a good solution to this problem. \n",

    "Looking at how long it took to train these models we can clearly see an outlier. The SVM model is taking significantly longer than to train and run. Around 100 seconds to train on the full data set whereas the Random forest model took just a second or too. The thing to note here is that performance of the SVM model did not get better as we increased the dataset size, it just become slower. This can become an hinderance if we want to analyse more individuals or include in more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend the you go with the Random Forest model. It is able to able to quickly build a good network of decision trees with the feature we have about the individual and out of that, make a good guess to whether they make more than $50K.\n",

    "The random forest model falls under the emsemble methods family. This simply means that the model is a combination (or 'ensemble') of multiple models. In the case of the random forest, it is a combination of multiple decision tree models. Say we have 3 different decision trees that all predict the the individual's income bracket based on different features. The random forest is simply the averaging of those 3 trees to provide a more generalised and reliable prediction on the income bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest model is trained using the 'bagging' method. This is where a random subset from the training set is used to fit a model on. Out of this random set we create a decision tree model. Then we take another random subset and build another tree from that. So on and so forth as we split the training set into these random subset. \n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from the random individual trees. One common aggregation method for classification tasks is to take the most 'voted' outcome. We have a data point (an individual) and the features are fed into each random tree and each tree makes a prediction on whether he makes more that more than $50K. We have 4 trees and 3 of them predicted that he makes more than $50K and 1 tree predicted he made less. The majority vote is that he makes more than $50K so that will be the outcome of the random forest.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
